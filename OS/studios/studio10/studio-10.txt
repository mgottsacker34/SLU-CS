2) 
void adder(race) {
    int i = 0;
    for(; i<2000000; i++) {
        race++;
    }
}

void subtractor(race) {
    int i = 0;
    for(; i<2000000; i++) {
        race--;
    }
}

3) I think the program will hang slightly as it computes all 4 million commands. It did just this, and as a point of curiosity, I printed the final value of race (which started at race = 0), and the program output “Race is -2145483649.” When I called the functions instead of just executing the two for loops in main, the program ran almost instantly and correctly returned “Race is 0.” 

4) I think the value of race will be random each time depending on the speed at which each thread accesses the data location race is stored at.
