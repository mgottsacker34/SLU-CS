5) I think the pointer winString points to the character “W”, i.e. the beginning of the string “Windows!”

6) W

7) i

9) I think that it will print the entire string beginning at whatever pointer value the loop is currently at.

It printed the following, confirming my guess:

Windows!
indows!
ndows!
dows!
ows!
ws!
s!
!

M
i
n
i
x
!

11) Trying to modify winString the same way we did linString results in a seg fault when you attempt to run the program.

12) The program runs properly, except the string “Windows!” is replace with “Solaris!” every time it is called. I kept my code from all the previous questions for this studio, and it correctly swapped the strings every time. I think this outcome is due to winString being placed in memory. If you modify it there it will be correctly modified whenever it is dereferenced.
